    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>

        <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes</li>
        <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
